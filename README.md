This is a very simple CRUD app for user management with React and Redux. It was deliberately made to be simple due to time constraints.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Note

- Default users and roles are in `./src/static/data.json`.
- To login with any of the user accounts in the data file, use the user's email address and email username+userId for password. For example, to login with Jon Snow's account, you'd use: (username=jonsnow@gmail.com, password=jon10001).
- To generate and browse the documentation, clone the repo and run `npm run generate-docs`, and then open `./docs/index.html` in your browser.
- The role privileges wasn't implemented to restrict access to pages based on roles, due to time constraints.
- The tests are not complete, due to time constraints.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run generate-docs`

Generates JSDOC documentation for the code into the `./docs` directory. To browse the documentation, open `./docs/index.html` in your browser.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
